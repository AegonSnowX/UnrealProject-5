ParkItUp(working title)– Winter Semester Project

Overview
This project is being developed as part of a winter semester academic project. The objective is to design and implement a vertical slice of a low-poly 3D parking game, focusing on technical execution and system design rather than large-scale content.

Project Focus
This project is designed to demonstrate:

Vehicle physics implementation

3D modelling skills

System-based game architecture

Gameplay mechanics & interaction design

The emphasis is placed on technical correctness, clarity of systems, and clean implementation.

Core Objectives

Vehicle Physics
The game will showcase arcade-style vehicle movement, including:

Acceleration

Braking / Reverse

Steering

Collision behavior

The goal is responsive and controllable driving, not full realism.

Gameplay Systems
The project applies structured game system design principles, separating:

Input systems

Gameplay logic

State management

Feedback systems

3D Modelling
All major assets will be created using low-poly modelling techniques, prioritizing:

Readability

Optimization

Clean geometry

Tools & Technologies

Game Engine
Unreal Engine (C++)

Core gameplay mechanics

Vehicle movement systems

Collision & rule logic

Implemented using C++ to reinforce engine-level programming and system architecture design.

3D Modelling
Blender

Used for:

Low-poly vehicle models

Environment assets

Obstacles & props

Development Environment
Visual Studio Code / Visual Studio

Used for:

C++ programming

Code management

Project workflow

Project Scope

This is a controlled vertical slice intended for academic evaluation.

2–3 playable levels

Low-poly art style

Core parking mechanics

Static & dynamic obstacles

Basic vehicle physics

The scope is intentionally limited to ensure technical depth and stability.

Learning Goals

This project serves as a practical exploration of:

Real-time game system architecture

Vehicle control mechanics

Physics interactions & collision handling

Gameplay rule validation

3D asset production pipeline

Engine-based C++ development

Status
In Development
